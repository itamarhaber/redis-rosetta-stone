# redis-rosetta-stone
An epic effort to capture the essence of Redis in all languages

Everybody knows that [Redis](https://github.com/antirez/redis) is an acronym for **RE**mote **DI**ctionary **S**erver. This repository is one half thought experiment, one half pedagogical project and the final half a joke. 

Original idea suggested by [@microspino](https://twitter.com/microspino/status/610149923238055937). Contribute by creating PRs with additional languages that you master.

The translation for each language must consist of the following attributes:
 * Language - the language's name
 * Script - the phonetic equivalent of Redis in native script
 * Script literal - the literal translation of Remote Dictionary Server in native script
 * Phonetic literal - the phonetic version of the native literal (use CA-PI-TALS or resort to IPA if needed)
 * Script acronym - acronymized native literal in native script
 * Phonetic acronym - the phonetic version of the native acronym
